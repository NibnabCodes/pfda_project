# **Mapping the Crisis: Demographic Trends in Suicide Mortality (Ireland and EU)**

## Project Overview ✨  

In this project, I analyse suicide mortality data to explore patterns and trends across Ireland and the European Union. The aim of this analysis is to identify how suicide mortality varies over time, across regions, and between demographic groups, using official statistical data and reproducible data analysis methods.

I begin by examining suicide mortality in Ireland using national and county level data. At the national level, I analyse suicide mortality trends from 2007 to 2022, exploring how patterns vary over time and across age groups and sex. This allows me to assess long-term temporal trends and demographic differences in suicide mortality at a population-wide scale.

I then focus on county-level suicide mortality data from 2015 to 2022 to examine regional variation across Ireland. This analysis identifies counties with consistently high and low numbers of deaths, evaluates changes in mortality over time within individual counties, and explores sex-based differences in suicide mortality using cumulative totals and male-to-female mortality ratios.

For the final analysis, I extend the analysis to a European context by examining standardised suicide mortality rates across EU countries between 2012 and 2016. I compare average mortality levels across countries, visualise temporal trends for high mortality countries, and identify countries that consistently deviate from the EU average.

Throughout the project, I use Python and pandas for data cleaning and aggregation, and matplotlib for visualisation. I prioritise clear, interpretable visual outputs and methodological transparency to support meaningful comparison across regions and over time. This project provides a multi-level overview of suicide mortality patterns and highlights areas of persistent concern as well as relative stability within Ireland and the EU.
